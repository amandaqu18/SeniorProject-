Description: A system that provides indoor location services utilizing multiple ESP 32 Gateway clients that scan for RSSI values using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon signal strength emitted by a Seeed Wio Terminal to triangulate its location. Coordination is managed by an ad hoc Wi-Fi network using messages passed through an MQTT broker hosted on an Onion Omega 2+. The system is implemented using three different embedded systems architectures, each specifically chosen for functionality.
